## Description

This module adds a simple ads slider widget to humhubs sidebar.  By default I integrated 6 slides.
Widget works on spaces, dashboard and profile. The modules base language is English.

Thx to @Felli the module does come now with Japanese and Korean language files by default!


## Slides/Image integration
**You have to integrate the slides manually**. 
To do it open **protected/modules/adspanel/widgets/views/adframe.php** 

near **line 11** replace my demo banners and also the demo links with Yours.
**You need very basic knowledge in HTML.**

## Caution!!!
